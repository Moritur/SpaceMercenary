# SpaceMercenary
This repositiory contains some scripts from one of my games made with Unity. Game is a multiplayer PvP space shooter.
Included scripts are responsible for loading ship's configuration choosen by player from JSON file and controlling ship's engines, weapons and other modules.

Full project will soon be posted on my Unity Connect porfile and link to it will be here.
